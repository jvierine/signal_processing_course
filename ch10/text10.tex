\index{Linear time-invariant systems}{Linear time-invariant systems}
(LTI) are an important class of systems that can be analyzed easily in frequency domain.
An LTI system is equivalent to \emph{\index{convolution}{convolution}} of the \emph{impulse response} of the system.
The focus of this chapter is to learn more about what these concepts are.

\section{Example: Running average filter}
Here's an example of a discrete-time system that you might use to smooth a noisy signal:
\begin{equation}
  y[n] = \frac{1}{15}\sum_{k=-7}^{7} x[n-k]\,\,.
  \label{eq:running_mean}
\end{equation}
What does this system do? It averages together 15 neighboring values of the input signal $x[n]$.
Figure \ref{fig:avg_filter} shows a demonstration of this system in action.
The blue line indicates a noisy input signal $x[n]$, and the orange line depicts the output
$y[n]$ of the running mean filter given in Equation \ref{eq:running_mean}.
As you might expect, the output of the system is a smoother version of the input signal.

  \end{center}
  \caption{Discrete-time LTI systems are characterized by an impulse response $h[n]$, 
  which is the response of the LTI system to a unit impulse signal.}
\end{marginfigure}

The previous system shown in Equation \ref{eq:running_mean} is a special case of a 
more general type of discrete-time LTI system,
known as a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. This type of signal is often 
used in digital signal processing.
An FIR filter is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    y[n] = \sum_{k=-M}^{N} b_k x[n-k]\,\,.
  }
  \label{eq:fir_filter}
\end{equation}
The coefficients $b_k \in \mathbb{C}$ here are constant valued coefficients. 
As the name implies, there is a finite number of non-zero coefficients $b_k$.
In the case of the running average filter in Equation \ref{eq:running_mean}, 
there would be 15 coefficients, which are all $b_k=1/15$.

\section{General discrete-time LTI system}
What if we allow there to be infinitely many coefficients for the system given 
in Equation \ref{eq:fir_filter}? We get the following:
\begin{equation}
  y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} b_k x[n-k] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} b[k] x[n-k]\,\,.
\end{equation}
This turns out to be the general representation for arbitrary discrete-time LTI systems! 
In this case, it makes sense to think of the infinitely many coefficients $b_k$ as a signal $b[k]$.

For discrete-time LTI systems in general, the output of a system is given by a discrete-time 
convolution sum of the input signal $x[n]$ with an impulse response $h[n]$:

  \caption{The impulse response of the 15 point running mean filter described in Equation \ref{eq:running_mean}.}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    y[n] = \mathcal{T}\{x[n]\}=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h[k] x[n-k]\,\,.
  }
  \label{eq:conv_dlti}
\end{equation}
The impulse response is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    h[n] = \mathcal{T}\{\delta[n]\}\,\,.
    \label{eq:conv_ireq}
  }
\end{equation}
It is hopefully easy to see that Equation \ref{eq:conv_dlti} is valid for all LTI systems. %This was already briefly discussed earlier in the chapter on Fourier transforms.

A linear system $\mathcal{T}\{\cdot\}$\footnote{If linearity applies for two input signals $\mathcal{T}\{\alpha_1 s_1[n] + \alpha_2 s_2[n]\} = \alpha_1 \mathcal{T}\{s_1[n]\}+\alpha_2 \mathcal{T}\{s_2[n]\}$, it also applies for linear combinations of three or more signals.} must by definition satisfy the following relation:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{T}\left\{\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha_k s_k[n]\right\} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \alpha_k \mathcal{T}\{s_k[n]\}\,\,.
  \label{eq:linearity_gen}
\end{equation}
Here $\alpha_k \in \mathbb{C}$ are arbitrary constants and $s_k[n]$ are arbitrary signals.

Time-invariance of $\mathcal{T}\{\cdot\}$, on the other hand, implies that for any 
time shift $k$ in the input, the output is correspondingly time shifted.
This is valid for any input signal $x[n]$:
\begin{equation}
  y[n-k] = \mathcal{T}\{x[n-k]\}\,\,,
\end{equation}
if
\begin{equation}
  y[n]=\mathcal{T}\{x[n]\}\,\,.
\end{equation}
It is possible to represent any signal $x[n]$ with the help of time-shifted unit 
impulse signals\sidenote{Recall that the discrete-time unit impulse is defined as:
  \begin{equation}
    \delta[n] = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rcr}
      1 & \mathrm{when}      & n=0 \\
      0 & \mathrm{otherwise} &     \\
    \end{array}
    \right.\,\,.
  \end{equation}

  It is the discrete-time equivalent of a Dirac delta function. The unit impulse 
  is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dt_unit_impulse}.
}:
\begin{equation}
  x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]\delta[n-k]\,\,.
\end{equation}
Linearity implies that:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{T}\{x[n]\} = \mathcal{T}\left\{\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}x[k]\delta[n-k]\right\} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}x[k] \mathcal{T}\{\delta[n-k]\}\,\,.

\noindent The equation above is the same as Equation \ref{eq:linearity_gen} with 
$s_k[n] = \delta[n-k]$ and $\alpha_k=x[k]$.  Due to time-invariance,
we can relate the impulse response $h[n]$ delayed by $k$ to the term
on the right-hand side above. If a unit impulse fed into the system is
\begin{equation}
  h[n] = \mathcal{T}\{\delta[n]\},
\end{equation}

  \caption{Discrete-time unit impulse signal $\delta[n]$ and a time-shifted version $\delta[n-n_0]$ centered at $n=n_0$.}
  \label{fig:dt_unit_impulse}
\end{marginfigure}
then a time-shifted unit impulse corresponds to a time-shifted output:
\begin{equation}
  h[n-k] = \mathcal{T}\{\delta[n-k]\}\,\,.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the output of an LTI system for an arbitrary input signal
$x[n]$ can be expressed using the impulse response $h[n]$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
  y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]h[n-k].
  \label{eq:convolution_intro}
\end{equation}
This type of equation is known as a discrete-time convolution sum. We have now shown 
that any discrete-time LTI system can be represented with such a convolution sum.
Note that Equation \ref{eq:convolution_intro} isn't quite yet the same as 
Equation \ref{eq:conv_dlti}. We will later show that the convolution sum is commutative, i.e., that:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k]h[n-k] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h[k]x[n-k].
\end{equation}
Which completes the proof.

\subsection{Example: Impulse response of an FIR filter}
An FIR filter (Equation \ref{eq:fir_filter}) has the following impulse response:
\begin{equation}
  h[n] = \sum_{k=-M}^{N} b_k \delta[n-k]\,\,.
\end{equation}
The signal $h[n]$ contains the values of the filter coefficients $h[n]=b_n$. Since there are 
a finite number of coefficients $b_k$, the impulse response $h[n]$
has non-zero values only in a finite range of samples. This is also where the 
name ``finite impulse response'' comes from.
\begin{marginfigure}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm,auto,>=latex']
      \node [int] (a) {FIR filter ($b_k$)};
      \node (b) [left of=a, coordinate] {a};
      %    \node (c) [below=a,node distance=3cm] {a};

      %\node [int, pin={[init]above:$p_0$}] (c) [right of=a] {$\frac{1}{s}$};
      \node [coordinate] (end) [right of=a]{};
      \path[->] (b) edge node {$\delta[n]$} (a);
      %\path[->] (a) edge node {$v$} (c);
      \draw[->] (a) edge node {$h[n]$} (end) ;
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The impulse response of an FIR filter is a signal that contains the coefficients. 
    For a finite number of coefficients $b_k$, the length of
    the non-zero portion of the impulse response is finite, and hence the name FIR.}
\end{marginfigure}


\section{Impulse response}
Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are fully characterized by an \index{impulse response} impulse response $h(t)$.
This impulse response is obtained by feeding a unit impulse into the LTI system:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    h(t) = \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t)\}\,\,.
  }
\end{equation}
Using an impulse response, it is possible to represent the output of any LTI system as 
a convolution between the impulse response and the input signal.
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    y(t) = \mathcal{T}\{x(t)\} = h(t)*x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\tau)x(t-\tau)d\tau\,\,.
  }
\end{equation}
Let's prove this. We'll first need to represent an arbitrary signal as a sum of unit impulses:
\begin{equation}
  x(t)  = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) d\tau\,\,.
\end{equation}
One way to think of this integral is that the unit impulse $\delta(t-\tau)$ ``selects'' the 
value of $x(\tau)$ where $\tau=t$.
Another way to think of this is that the Dirac delta functions form a set of basis functions 
for representing the signal $x(t)$.

\begin{marginfigure}

      \node [int] (a) [align=center]{LTI };
      \node (b) [left of=a, coordinate] {a};
      %    \node (c) [below=a,node distance=3cm] {a};

      %\node [int, pin={[init]above:$p_0$}] (c) [right of=a] {$\frac{1}{s}$};

      %  \path[->] (b) edge node [below]{$\delta(t)$} (a);

      %\path[->] (a) edge node {$v$} (c);
      \draw[->] (a) edge node {$h(t)$} (end) ;
      %   \draw[->] (a) edge node [below]{$h(t)$} (end) ;

    \end{tikzpicture}

  \end{center}
  \caption{A linear time-invariant system is characterized by an impulse response.}
\end{marginfigure}

You may recall that linearity of the system $\mathcal{T}\{\cdot\}$ implies that:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{T}\{c_1 \delta(t-\tau_1) + c_2 \delta(t-\tau_2)\} = c_1 \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t-\tau_1)\}+ c_2 \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t-\tau_2)\}\,\,.
\end{equation}
Here I've used $\delta(t-\tau_1)$ and $\delta(t-\tau_2)$ as two different input signals. 
The terms $c_1,c_2\in \mathbb{C}$ are arbitrary complex-valued constants.

Linearity must therefore also apply for the linear combination of an arbitrary number of inputs:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{T}\left\{\sum_n x_n \delta(t-\tau_n)\right\} = \sum_n x_n \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t-\tau_n)\}\,\,.
\end{equation}
Linearity can be extended even further into a continuous linear combination:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{T}\left\{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau)\delta(t-\tau)d\tau\right\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t-\tau)\} d\tau\,\,.
\end{equation}
We can simplify the right-hand side and get:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t-\tau)\} d\tau = \mathcal{T}\left\{x(t)\right\}\,\,.
\end{equation}
In order to simplify the left-hand side, we have to rely on the property of \emph{time-invariance}. That is:
\begin{equation}
  h(t) = \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t)\} \Rightarrow h(t-\tau) = \mathcal{T}\{\delta(t-\tau)\}\,\,.
\end{equation}
This now completes our proof:
\begin{equation}
  y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d\tau = \mathcal{T}\left\{x(t)\right\}\qed\,\,.
\end{equation}
The output of a linear time-invariant system $y(t)=\mathcal{T}\{x(t)\}$ is a convolution of the system's
impulse response $h(t)=\mathcal{T}\{\delta(t)\}$ with the input signal $x(t)$ fed into the system.

\section{Convolution}

A convolution operation is defined for both continuous-time and
discrete-time signals. As we just saw, a convolution operation can be
interpreted as an LTI system applied to a signal.

The continuous-time convolution is defined as an integral:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    a(t)*b(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}a(\tau)b(t-\tau)d\tau\,\,.
  }
\end{equation}
The discrete-time convolution is defined as a sum:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
  a[n]*b[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}a[k]b[n-k]\,\,.
  }
\end{equation}

\section{Properties of a convolution}
The properties of the convolution operation are shown in Table \ref{con:table}. 
The same properties also exist for the continuous-time convolution
operation.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Table of convolution properties}
  \label{con:table}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    Property     & Equation                                     \\ \hline
    identity     & $x[n]*\delta[n]=x[n]$                        \\ \hline
    commutative  & $a[n] * b[n] = b[n] * a[n]$                  \\ \hline
    associative  & $(a[n]*b[n]) * c[n] = a[n] * ( b[n] * c[n])$ \\ \hline
    distributive & $a[n]*(b[n]+c[n]) = a[n]*b[n] + a[n]*c[n]$   \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The proof of the identity property is clear, and the commutative property is left as an exercise. 
The associative property takes a bit more work, and the proof is as follows:
\begin{proof}
  Using the definition of the convolution operation twice:
  \begin{align}
    (a[n]*b[n])*c[n] & = \sum_{k}\underbrace{\left(\sum_\ell a[\ell]b[k-\ell]\right)}_{a[k]*b[k]} c[n-k] \\
                     & = \sum_{k}\sum_\ell a[\ell]b[k-\ell]c[n-k]
  \end{align}
  For the other ordering:
  \begin{align}
    a[n]*(b[n]*c[n]) & = \sum_{\ell} a[\ell] \Big(\underbrace{\sum_m b[m]c[(n-m)}_{b[n]*c[n]}-\ell]\Big) \\
                     & = \sum_{\ell} \sum_m a[\ell] b[m]c[(n-m)-\ell]\,\,.
  \end{align}
  If we now substitute: $m=k-\ell$, then $n-m-\ell=n-k$, which gives
  \begin{align}
    a[n]*(b[n]*c[n]) & = \sum_{k} \underbrace{\left(\sum_{\ell} a[\ell] b[k-\ell]\right)}_{a[k]*b[k]} c[n-k]\,\,,
  \end{align}
  which is the same as $(a[n]*b[n])*c[n]$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

  \label{fig:cascade_lti1}
\end{marginfigure}

A consequence of the associative property is that if we have two LTI
systems that are applied to an input signal $x[n]$ in series, we can
come up with a single LTI system that is equivalent to two \index{chained
  LTI system} chained LTI systems:
\begin{equation}
  y[n] = (x[n]*h_1[n])*h_2[n] = x[n]*h_3[n]\,\,.
\end{equation}
Here $h_3[n]=h_1[n]*h_2[n]$. This is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:cascade_lti1}. This property can be extended to an arbitrary
number of systems that are connected together in series.

The convolution is distributive:
\begin{equation}
  a[n]*(b[n]+c[n]) = a[n]*b[n] + a[n]*c[n]\,\,.
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{align}
    a[n]*(b[n]+c[n]) & = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a[k](b[n-k]+c[n-k])                                   \\
                     & = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a[k]b[n-k]+ \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} a[k]c[n-k]\,\,.
  \end{align}
\end{proof}

An example application of this property is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:sum_lti}. Signals $x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n]$ fed into an identical
LTI systems separately and then added together is equivalent to the
sum of the signals fed into a single LTI system.


\section{Example: Convolution animations}

Animations of the convolution operation can be found
under \verb|code/017_fir_animation|. The code for creating such
animations is also included in the same directory.

\caption{An example of the convolution operation for the 13-bit Barker code and the corresponding matched filter used often in radar and sonar applications to increase the effective power of the transmit pulse. The convolution of the matched filter $x^*[-n]$ and the transmit code $x[n]$ should be as close to a unit impulse $P\delta[n]$ as possible for a good radar transmit code. Here $P$ is a constant indicating how much power is contained within the pulse. This and other example animations of the convolution operation can be found under the \texttt{code/017\symbol{95}fir\symbol{95}animation} directory.}
